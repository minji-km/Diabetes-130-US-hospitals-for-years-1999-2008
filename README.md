Data analysis and prediction on hospital readmission

The data set represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. It includes over 50 features representing patient and hospital outcomes. From this dataset, we want to know how well we can predict hospital readmission and what are the features that are the most significant predictors among these features.
